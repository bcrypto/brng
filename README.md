## What is Brng?

Brng is a series of pseudorandom number generation algorithms 
standardized in Belarus (STB 34.101.47).

The Brng standard additionally defines:
- the HMAC mechanism (according to 
  [RFC2104](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2104.txt)); 
- the OTP mechanisms (according to 
  [RFC4226](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4226.txt), 
  [RFC6238](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6238.txt), 
  [RFC6287](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6287.txt)).
